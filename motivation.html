                <h2>Core Philosophy: The Grind is the Glory</h2>
                <h3>Learning is Effort, Not Fun</h3>
                <p>Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary
                    feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like a "10 minute full body" workout and
                    a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating.</p>
                <p>Declare your intent up front: are you consuming content to be entertained or to learn? Close those
                    tabs of "Learn XYZ in 10 minutes". Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the
                    textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes,
                    re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.</p>

                <h3>Are You Even Trying?</h3>
                <p>If your day-to-day work doesn't make you hate it for how difficult it is to learn new ideas in that
                    area, are you really even trying? Your brain should feel overwhelmed with how much there is to learn
                    and how little time you have.</p>

                <h2>The Playbook: How to Study</h2>
                <h3>Productivity Framework</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Break down every single thing into a consumable piece and know the "why" for each.</li>
                    <li>Have a clear goal for each study session.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated timer (90min focus / 10min break) and meditation (17 min) is all you need.</li>
                    <li>Use Anki to store any important piece of information.</li>
                    <li>If content is hard -> sit the fuck down and bear the discomfort. This is the sign of your brain
                        changing and adapting. Break down every concept and learn bit by bit.</li>
                    <li>Have strong resilience. There is no cheat code or shortcut to success - you have to put in the
                        hours.</li>
                    <li>Getting better is a product of Practice and Consistency.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Metathinking:</b> Think about how to solve the problem. Have a structured approach. Make a
                        framework.</li>
                    <li><b>Building Mental Models:</b> Generalize from problems. Each problem should teach something.
                        Connect concepts.</li>
                    <li><b>Study the Solution:</b> Ask WHY. Learn from it. Generalize the pattern.</li>
                    <li><b>The 4-Step Process:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Attempt:</b> Think on your own for 30-50 minutes.</li>
                            <li><b>Understand:</b> Read the actual solution and fully understand it.</li>
                            <li><b>Rebuild:</b> Reconstruct the solution on your own from scratch.</li>
                            <li><b>Log:</b> Document what made the solution click. This is important.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Analyze your wrong answers. Learn concepts to unlock new tools.</li>
